# UPDATE-LOG
This project is unfinished. I mean it kinda worked when I turn it in for the asessment, but barely
With that out of the way, my plan is to update it, add features and shape it the way so that this app makes sense. 
 
# Revisiting an old code 
The first contact and the first plain issue: can't really run this app, ouch.
I can't connect through myLibraryApp's profile (edge's thinking my connection's suspicius) I'm fine with the ISS Express though.
There's this and many other issues, that need to be fixed. A lot of salvaging waiting ahead. 
Here are changes I want to make in the project from the top of my head:

- Swap Entity Framework with Dapper
- Change database from SQL Server to MySQL 
- Dockerize all this crap? It'd be fun
